    "# Developing a quiz prototype to use in JN\n",
    "\n",
    "This development started after realizing that the \"jupyter-quiz\" project in GitHub wasn't going to meet our needs for training content. Given that project seems to have gone cold, I thought it best to take a fresh approach.\n",
    "\n",
    "I found some forums where people have been working on things like this before for JN, so I started by adapting some code I found here.\n",
    "\n",
    "As part of making this work, I had to make sure I had installed and enabled *ipywidgets*. I had a little trouble with this, so I'm sharing the three commands I used on my macOS to get things set up:\n",
    "~~~\n",
    "> pip install jupyter-js-widgets-nbextension\n",
    "> jupyter nbextension install --user --py widgetsnbextension\n",
    "> jupyter nbextension enable --user --py widgetsnbextension\n",
    "~~~\n",
    "After running these commands, the notebooks I ran locally could import and use from ipywidgets.\n",
    "\n",
    "The rest of this notebook is the experiments applying widgets and Python code to set up different types of questions and different ways of processing the question feedback.\n",
